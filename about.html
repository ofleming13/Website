<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is the about section. I will bore you with some useless information. If I were you I would stop reading now and stare at the dog gifs for a while.
  This website was founded at some point in time. At this specific point in time the `Boss Dog` from the homescreen took over da gaf and became a tyrannical ruler. However this would be his downfall as his workers grew tired of his rule and assasinated him. Since that fateful day da gaf has lived in peace. The End
